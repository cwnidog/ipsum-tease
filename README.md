PROBLEM TO SOLVE:
=================

Sometimes you want a T-shirt to say something, even if you have nothing to say.
We take care of that problem, allowing a customer to purchase a T-shirt in one
of three styles; standard, long-sleeved, and baseball without leaving their
home.

          -Font Selector

      -Shopping Cart
        -Checkout

      -Add-On's (Time allowing)

        -Save favorite shirts
        -Delete shirts

APPROACH:
=========

We used an Agile-style approach to the project with morning scrums and a Kanban, but while the scrum stayed useful, the Kanban fell by the wayside. We originally took an approach where everyone was responsible for a set of features, but we evolved into a back-end/front-end arrangement with Forrest handling the back-end and Sam & John handling the front-end. In the middle of the project things seemed to be going a bit off the rails. After discussing with Brooke & Ryan, we sat down and replanned a bit. In doing so, we were able to find an approach that allowed us to provide the same functionality in a simpler manner, making use of local storage and jnode.

INDIVIDUAL LESSONS LEARNED:
===========================

John - I learned quite a bit more about HTML and jQuery on this project. Also I was able to brush up on my software project management, knocking some of the rust off. I learned almost as much researching things that we *didn't* do as I did for the thing sthat we did end up using. For instance, use of a pop-up window to provide a pull-down menu. It was really excess to requirements so we decided not to use it, but finding out how was interesting. Additionally, this project got me very comfortable with using git. I also enjoyed seeing the project page look good on a MacBook, iPad, and iPhone.

SEA-B26-FOUNDATIONS BOOTCAMP
FINAL PROJECT

=====IPSUM-TEASE=====

TEAM MEMBERS:
  1.SAM HAMM
  2.JOHN LEONARD
  3.FORREST PARKER

PROBLEM TO SOLVE:
=================

Sometimes you want a T-shirt to say something, even if you have nothing to say.
We take care of that problem, allowing a customer to purchase a T-shirt in one
of three styles; standard, long-sleeved, and baseball without leaving their
home.

GOALS:
  -Design a shop that allows basic user interaction
    *Including:

      -Shop
        -Basic Page Navigation
        -Womens, Mens, Kids
        -Random Shirt Generation (using ipsum generator)
          -Font Selector

      -Shopping Cart
        -Checkout
          -Forms take in contact info and location from user

      -Add-On's (Time allowing)
        -Add shirt styles & colors
        -Save favorite shirts
        -Delete shirts

APPROACH:
=========

We used an Agile-style approach to the project with morning scrums and a Kanban. While the scrum stayed useful, the Kanban fell by the wayside as we were a small team working in close proximity. The first thing we did was to try to come up with a reasonable project idea, but most things seemed a bit elaborate. Sam was discussing our ideas with Craig and Andrew and they mentioned the idea of selling t-shirts with printing from Lorem Ipsum on them and we expanded on that to include sayings from other ipsums, as well. The entire team sat down to come up with a list of personae describing potential customers and their needs. They all boiled down to needing a convenient to buy a t-shirt with a witty saying - but  without actually going to a brick & mortar store. We originally took an approach where everyone was responsible for a set of features, but we evolved into a back-end/front-end arrangement with Forrest handling the back-end and Sam & John handling the front-end. In the middle of the project things seemed to be going a bit off the rails. After discussing with Brooke & Ryan, we sat down and replanned a bit. In doing so, we were able to find an approach that allowed us to provide most of the same functionality as planned in a simpler manner, making use of local storage, JSON, and jnode. As part of the replan, the font selection and our original plan to let the customer pick & choose snippets from a list combining them as they pleased were postponed to a hypothetical later release.

INDIVIDUAL LESSONS LEARNED:
===========================

John - I learned quite a bit more about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery on this project. Also I was able to brush up on my software project management skills, knocking some of the rust off. I learned almost as much researching things that we *didn't* do as I did for the things that we did end up using. For instance, use of an animated pop-up window to provide a pull-down menu (would hav etaken far too long and didn't add any real value beyond a "gee whiz" factor). It was really excess to requirements so we decided not to use it, but finding out how was interesting. Additionally, this project got me very comfortable with using git. I also enjoyed seeing the project page look good on a MacBook, iPad, and iPhone. It was really great being part of a software development team again, no matter how short the duration.

Sam
* I learned a lot more about how all of the puzzle pieces fit together in a project like this, that there is a blend of code and people and technology and tools and imaginary users and workflows that all eventually must mesh.
* Git, Git, and more Git (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCadcBR95oU)
* Lots of improvement in my snesibility toward collaborative work. I've always been a lone wolf, or in a group project, just the guy who does everything for everyone else. In this dynamic, I'm coming to a greater understanding of the tradeoffs between the security of control and the positive effects of contributions of others.
* Overall, this project brought about improved skills in my HTML, CSS, jQuery, and JS, and further helped to illustrate how much I still have ahead of me to learn. It's been humbling and challenging. I can say that about the entire bootcamp experience, in general.

Forrest -
I learned a ton about jQuery and Node.js. Also, it was excellent practice getting to work with a team where we each were responsible for a portion of the work but also able to assist eachother with any difficulties that arouse.
I think the biggest lesson though was not to get too attached to the original idea. As the work progresses it's important to be able to change your approach especially when facing a difficult problem.  We also learned that some ideas, while they may at first sound simple, can be really complex so it's best to start with the most simple 'dry' approach possible, after which it's much simple to expand your project.
